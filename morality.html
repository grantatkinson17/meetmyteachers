     <h1>PHIL 1304: Morality and Justice</h1>
     <h2>Professor</h2>
       <p>The professor for Morality and Justice is Dr. Gregory Novack. He is very
       knowladgeable, but he also a dry and sarcastic sense of humor, which makes
       me really like him.</p2>
     <h3>Education</h3>
       <p>Dr. Novack got his undergraduate degree from Washington University in St.
       Louis. He then went on to earn his Ph.D. at WIsconsin-Madison.</p>
     <h3>Interests</h3>
       <p>While Dr. Novack is very serious about his job, he also has many outside
       interests. He enjoys playing and listening to music, and he also loves sports.
       In particular, Dr. Novack is interested in tennis, hockey, and baseball. While
       he has not completed any University sponsored research, he has published many
       professional articles, including one for the Journal of Philosophical Logic
       entitled "A Defense of the Principle of Indifference."</p>
     <h2>Class Description</h2>
       <p>In this class, we discuss general principles of Philosophy such as
       the moral statuses of actions. Then, we apply that knowledge to specific hot
       button topics such as abortion and capital punishment. We also examine articles
       from well-known philosophers and dissect their arguments about abortion, capital
       punishment, or other subjects.</p>
     <h2>Opinion</h2>
       <p>I really like this class. At first I was just taking it in order to fulfill
       a credit requirement, but I have really become interested in the subject matter.
       I am a prety logic-heavy person, so the dissecting arguments and those types of things
       generally come pretty easy to me. I also have strong opinions on issues, and I
       like to discuss those (in a respectful manner.)</p>
     <h2>Expected Grade</h2>
       <p>I currently have an A in this class. Professor Novack also drops the lowest
       three to four quizzes, so that will be helpful. I expect to keep an A for
       my final grade.</p>
