     <h2>Class Description</h2>
       <p>In this class, we discuss general principles of Philosophy such as
       the moral statuses of actions. Then, we apply that knowledge to specific hot
       button topics such as abortion and capital punishment. We also examine articles
       from well-known philosophers and dissect their arguments about abortion, capital
       punishment, or other subjects.</p>
     <h2>Opinion</h2>
       <p>I really like this class. At first I was just taking it in order to fulfill
       a credit requirement, but I have really become interested in the subject matter.
       I am a prety logic-heavy person, so the dissecting arguments and those types of things
       generally come pretty easy to me. I also have strong opinions on issues, and I
       like to discuss those (in a respectful manner.)</p>
     <h2>Expected Grade</h2>
       <p>I currently have an A in this class. Professor Novack also drops the lowest
       three to four quizzes, so that will be helpful. I expect to keep an A for
       my final grade.</p>
