     <h1>COMM 2034: Visual Media</h1>
     <h2>Professor</h2>
       <p>The professor for my Visual Media class is Dr. Carlos Evia. Dr. Evia is
         a fun loving teacher who is very easy to learn from. He is also grading
         this project, so is that why I am saying nice things about him? You will
         never know.</p>
     <h3>Education</h3>
       <p>Dr. Evia earned his MSC from Universidad LaSalle in Mexico City. He then
       went on to complete his PhD at Texas Tech University.
     <h3>Interests</h3>
       <p>Outside of teaching Visual Media, Dr. Evia has expertise in many other
       subjects. Namely, he is expereienced in Technical Communication, User
       Documentation, Structured Authoring, Workplace Safety, and Hispanic
       Construction Workers. He is also a member ofthe Darwin Information Typing
       Architecture Technical Committee and the Society for Technical
       Communication, among other things. He was awarded the Outstanding Faculty
       Outreach award by the Virginia Tech College of Liberal Arts and Human
       Sciences in May of 2011.</p>
     <h3>Research</h3>
       <p>Like many Virginia Tech professors, Dr. Evia participates in University
       sponsored research. His most significant research opportunity came when he
       named a Co-Principal Investigator for the "Microprocesses of Latino
       Construction Workers' Health: Feasability of CATS" project. Dr. Evia was
       awarded $250,000 for the reseach, and he worked with the National Institute
       of Occupational Safety and Health from 2009-2012 on the project.</p2>
     <h2>Class Description</h2>
       <p>In Visual Media, we learn the essential skills to communicate through
       other mediums besides just text. Our four main projects involved employing
       communication techniques through page layout, photos, videos, and web
       presence.</p>
     <h2>Opinion</h2>
       <p>I honestly have enjoyed Visual Media Class. At first, I was very
       nervous, because I do not have very much expereince when it comes to
       video and photo editing. However, the class has been able to challenge me
       without being so hard that I feel discouraged. I have learned a lot of
       essential skills for my desired future jobs, namely how to use Adobe
       Photoshop and Premiere.</p>
     <h2>Expected Grade</h2>
       <p>I currently have a B plus in this class. We still have a couple of projects
       to go, so if I do well on those, I should be able to bring it up to an A
       or A minus.</p>
