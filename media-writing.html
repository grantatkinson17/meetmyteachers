     <h1>COMM 2024: Media Writing</h1>
     <h2>Professor</h2>
       <p>Natalia Mielczarek teaches my section of Media Writing. Dr. Mielczarek is
       pretty strict, which honestly made me not a huge fan of hers at first.
       However, as I get to know her more, I am realizing that she has our best
       interest in mind, and she is very willing to help if we ask for it.</p2>
     <h3>Education</h3>
       <p>Dr. Mielczarek got her bachelor's degree from Vanderbilt University in
       Nashville, Tennessee. Next, she earned her M.A. from the University
       of Missouri School of Journalism. Lastly, she completed her PhD at the
       University of Iowa.
     <h3>Interests</h3>
       <p>Dr. Mielczarek has always been interested in many aspects of Communication.
       She has expertise in Visual Communication, Iconic Images, and Digital
       Participatory Culture and Viral Content. In addition, she is involved in
       multiple communication based activities professionally. Dr. Mielczarek is
       involved in the Association for Education Journalism and Mass Communication,
       as well as the International Communication Association. While she has not
       yet participated in any University sponsored research, Dr. Mielczarek has
       written multiple professional articles, including a study with the United
       States Army War College Press entitled, "Big pictures and visual propaganda:
       The lessons of research on the ‘effects’ of photojournalistic icons."</p>
     <h2>Class Description</h2>
       <p>This class is basically simulating the feel of a traditional news room.
       We have had many projects such as a basic news story, a press release, a
       feature story, and an investigative story. For each piece, we have to
       present a pitch, personally interview a certain number of sources, and
       then write our story.</p>
     <h2>Opinion</h2>
       <p>To be completely honest, I am not a huge fan of this class. As an
       aspiring journalist, I usually enjoy writing stories like this. However,
       the amount of sources required for each story in this class seems
       excessive. In addition, we are just students, not professional
       journalists, so many people have no desire to let us interview them.
       Still, this class does help me learn the essential skills for my desired
       job, albeit sometimes the hard way.</p>
     <h2>Expected Grade</h2>
       <p>As this is my hardest class, I was struggling at the beginning. However,
       I have started to do better in the class recently, and I have pulled my
       grade up to a B. I would love to get an A in this class, but given the
       difficulty, I think the B plus range is more likely.</p>
