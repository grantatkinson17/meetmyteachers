     <h1>GOVT 1014: US Government and Politics</h1>
     <h2>Professor</h2>
       <p>The professor for US Government and Politics is Dr. Nicholas Goedert.
       Dr. Goedert is extremely knowladgeable about the United States government,
       and he is very approachable any time you need help.</p>
     <h3>Education</h3>
       <p>Dr. Goedert got his bachelors' degree in Social Studies from Harvard
       University. Next, he earned a J.D. from Georgetown Law School. He then
       went to Princeton University, where he earned first his M.A. and then
       his Ph.D, both in Politics.</p>
     <h3>Interests</h3>
       <p>Dr. Goedert has expertise in many subjects related to American Politics,
       such as Electoral Institutions, Congressional Politics, Election Law, and
       Public Opinion. He has served on the American Political Science Association,
       the American Association of Political Consultants, and the Maryland State
       Bar, among other things. In 2017, he was awarded the Artinian Travel Award
       by the Southern Pines Political Science Association. While Dr. Goedert has
       not yet completed any official Virginia Tech sponsored research, he served
       as a research assistant to Tali Mendelberg and Tom Romer at Princeton.</p>
     <h2>Class Description</h2>
       <p>This class is really just the absoulte basics of the branches of US Government.
       In the first couple of units, we discussed the formation of the office of the President,
       the House of Representatives, and the Congress. The second half of the class
       is where we have gotten more into the politics side of things. Specifically, we
       discuss campaign tactics, as well as how the two party system came to be.</p>
     <h2>Opinion</h2>
       <p>For the most part, I enjoy this class. I am passionate about politics,
       so that portion of the class is my favorite. The only bad thing about it
       is that this class takes place in a huge lecture hall, and it is an hour
       and fifteen minutes long. Those two elements combined sometimes make it
       hard to stay engaged.</p>
     <h2>Expected Grade</h2>
       <p>I currently have a B plus in US Government and Politics. Dr. Goedert puts
       a pretty heavy curve on his quizzes, so I don't expect that grade to drop lower than
       a B. In fact, I think I could possibly bring it up to an A minus.</p>
