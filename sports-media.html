     <h1>COMM 2074: Intro To Sports Media</h1>
     <h2>Professor</h2>
       <p>The professor for this Intro to Sports Media class is Bill Roth. Mr.
       Roth is one of the coolest people I have ever met, and he is an outstanding
       professor. He also has extensive expereince in the field, which I will
       describe in the next section.</p2>
     <h3>Education</h3>
       <p>Bill Roth got his bachelor's degree from Syracuse University in Broadcast
       Journalism.</p>
     <h3>Interests</h3>
       <p>Mr. Roth is one of the more interesting professors here at Virginia
       Tech. He was the play by play announcer for Virginia Tech Athletics
       for 27 years before moving to California in 2015. After one year, he came
       back to Blacksburg and helped establish a strong Sports Media Concentration
       within the Multimedia Journalism major. As a professor of practice, Mr. Roth
       still serves as a play-by-play braodcaster for select games on ESPN on top
       of teaching.</p>
     <h2>Class Description</h2>
       <p>At the begininng of the year, Professor Roth described this class as
       the Golden Coral of Sports Journalism classes. What he means by this is that
       we cover all kinds of different topic in Sports Journalism. These topics
       include Sports Analytics, Marketing, Writing, Broadcasting, and much more.</p>
     <h2>Opinion</h2>
       <p>I really love this class. Since Sports Writing is pretty much what I want
       to do as a job, that probably makes sense. I am very passionate about this,
       so it makes it not even seem like work when I have to do homework or anything
       for this class. It is also very applicable to my desired job of Sports Writer
       and/or Broadcaster. I find that it is much easier to do assignments if they
       are direcrly related to what I want to do in the future.</p>
     <h2>Expected Grade</h2>
       <p>I currently have an A in this class. I think there is a chance that I
       could bring it up to an A plus, but I will be happy with just a regualr A.</p>
